***Hello*** My name is Chris

I have a love 💖 and passion for wildlife and tech 💻.  
I have dabbled in code on/off trying to self teach C# with the aim of developing games using Unity and Blender.  

 ***Now*** 💪 feels the right time to make a positive move forward in my coding journey; Which is why i have enrolled on techeducators Full-stack Bootcamp to give me a good foundation which i can then build upon while supporting my learning to become a junior developer .  
In the future i would **LOVE** to build accessible games and apps for those whom live with additional needs. 

On a personnal level i use wildlife 🐦 and nature 🍃 as my therapy and capture this with my camera 📸  
long walks and hours of sitting and waiting listening the sounds of birds, transports me away from all the hussle and bussle of modern life to a place of clarity to allow myself to think.

# Growth Mindset  

> Growth Mindset is the belief that your knowledge and abilities are able to be developed and improved by hardwork and dedication. While Talent is just a starting block.

* How to maintain a growth mindset
  1. Effort - ***Always apply 100%*** energy as good outcomes require exertion (mental, Physical or repetition).
  2. Challenge - ***See challenges as exciting***, engaging as these **are** oppotunities to learn something valuable from your experiences.
  3. Mistakes/Feedback - ***Dont be affraid to make mistakes!***  Mistakes are also oppotunities to develop knowledge and not something to be embarressed over.  feedback can help improve in the future and is not personal.
