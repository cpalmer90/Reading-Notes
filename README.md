# About me

***Hello*** My name is chris.

I have a love and passion for wildlife and tech. 
I have dabbled in code on/off trying to self teach C# with the aim of developing games using unity. 

 ***Now*** feels the right time to make a positive move forward in my coding journey to give me a good foundation which i can then build upon.
In the future i would **LOVE** to build accessible games and apps for those whom live with additional needs. 

i use wildlife and nature as my therapy and capture this with my camera. long walks and hours of sitting and waiting listening the sounds of birds, transports me away from all the hussle and bussle of modern life.
