# About me

****

***Hello*** My name is chris:heavy_exclamation_mark: :grinning:

I have a love :sparkling_heart: and passion for wildlife and tech :computer:. 
I have dabbled in code on/off trying to self teach C# with the aim of developing games using unity. 

 ***Now*** :muscle: feels the right time to make a positive move forward in my coding journey to give me a good foundation which i can then build upon.
In the future i would **LOVE** to build accessible games and apps for those whom live with additional needs. 

On a personnal level i use wildlife :bird: and nature :leaves: as my therapy and capture this with my camera :camera:.

long walks and hours of sitting and waiting listening the sounds of birds, transports me away from all the hussle and bussle of modern life to a place of clarity to allow myself to think.
