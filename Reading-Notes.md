***Hello*** My name is Chris

I have a love üíñ and passion for wildlife and tech üíª. 
I have dabbled in code on/off trying to self teach C# with the aim of developing games using unity. 

 ***Now*** üí™ feels the right time to make a positive move forward in my coding journey to give me a good foundation which i can then build upon.
In the future i would **LOVE** to build accessible games and apps for those whom live with additional needs. 

On a personnal level i use wildlife üê¶ and nature üçÉ as my therapy and capture this with my camera üì∏

long walks and hours of sitting and waiting listening the sounds of birds, transports me away from all the hussle and bussle of modern life to a place of clarity to allow myself to think.
