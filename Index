# Growth Mindset  

> Growth Mindset is the belief that your knowledge and abilities are able to be developed and improved by hardwork and dedication. While Talent is just a starting block.

* How to maintain a growth mindset
  1. Effort - ***Always apply 100%*** energy as good outcomes require exertion (mental, Physical or repetition).
  2. Challenge - ***See challenges as exciting***, engaging as these **are** oppotunities to learn something valuable from your experiences.
  3. Mistakes/Feedback - ***Dont be affraid to make mistakes!***  Mistakes are also oppotunities to develop knowledge and not something to be embarressed over.  feedback can help improve in the future and is not personal.
